- Sets

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. Since they are unordered, you cannot iterate through them by index. However, Python provides ways to loop through their elements.For loop will print each element in the set on a new line. The order may vary in each run as sets are unordered.

- Tuples:

Tuples are ordered sequences of elements, similar to lists. They are immutable, meaning elements cannot be changed after creation.
1. for loop with index
A loop iterates through the indices of a tuple and uses them to access elements using bracket notation.
2. for loop with unpacking
A loop unpacks the elements of the tuple into variablesin each iteration.
